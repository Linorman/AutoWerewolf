## **Basic Rules**

### **Teams**
- **Werewolves (4 players)**: Work together to eliminate the villagers or all the special roles ("seers," "witch," etc.).
- **Villagers (4 players)**: Have no special powers; rely on discussion and voting.
- **Special Roles / "Gods" (4 players)**: Have unique abilities to help the village identify and eliminate werewolves.

### **Win Conditions**
- **Village (Good Team) Wins**: When **all werewolves are eliminated**.
- **Werewolves Win** (in a "Side-Elimination" or *Tu Bian* format, which is most common):  
  - If **all villagers** are dead **or**  
  - If **all special roles** are dead.  
  (Alternative: *City-Elimination*/*Tu Cheng*—kill all good players—but this is less common.)

> Note: Werewolves can also win if, during a daytime vote, they hold a majority or tie in votes, making it impossible for villagers to eliminate them.

## **Game Flow (Day/Night Cycle)**

### **Night Phase** (all players close eyes)
1. **Werewolves** wake up, silently agree on a target to “kill” (via gestures).
2. **Special roles** wake up **one by one** (in a set order known only to the moderator) to use their powers:
   - **Seer** checks one player’s alignment (good or bad).
   - **Witch** may **save** the killed player (once per game) or **poison** someone (once per game).
   - **Guard** may protect someone (not the same person two nights in a row).
   - **Hunter** and **Village Idiot** have passive or reactive abilities (see below).

> All roles act **before** deaths are announced—so a player killed at night can still use their ability **that same night**, if applicable.

### **Day Phase**
1. **First Day Only**: **Sheriff Election** occurs before deaths are announced.
2. Moderator announces who died **last night**.
3. **Only the first-night death** gets a **final statement (last words)** if killed at night. All **daytime lynched** players **always** get last words.
4. Players discuss in turn (order may be set by sheriff or death position).
5. All vote to **lynch** one player.
6. The lynched player gives **last words**.
7. Game proceeds to next night.

## **Roles and Abilities (Standard 12-Player Setup)**

### **Werewolves (4)**
- **Ability**: Kill one player each night by consensus.
- **Special Action**: Can **self-explode** (*zi bao*) during the day—immediately ends discussion and skips to night (they die).
- **Terminology**:
  - **"Knife"** = to kill (e.g., “He was knifed last night”).
  - **"Self-knife"** = a werewolf kills another werewolf to fake being innocent (e.g., to trick the Witch into wasting her cure).

### **Villagers (4)**
- No powers. Must use logic and discussion to identify werewolves.

### **Special Roles – Two Common Sets**

#### **Set A**: Seer, Witch, Hunter, Guard  
#### **Set B**: Seer, Witch, Hunter, Village Idiot

| Role | Ability | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Seer** | Each night, checks if one player is werewolf or not. | **"Gold Water"**: Verified good player.<br>**"Checked Kill"**: Verified werewolf. |
| **Witch** | Has **1 cure** (save a night-killed player) and **1 poison** (kill someone). Can use **only one per night**. Usually **cannot heal self** (except sometimes on Night 1). | **"Silver Water"**: Player saved by Witch—usually considered good, but less reliable than Seer’s check. |
| **Hunter** | When killed **by vote or werewolves**, may **shoot** one player. **Cannot shoot if poisoned** by Witch. | Moderator informs Hunter nightly whether they can shoot. |
| **Guard** | Protects one player each night (including self). **Cannot guard same person two nights in a row**. | **"Same Guard Same Save"**: If Guard protects and Witch saves the same person, they **still die**. |
| **Village Idiot** (alternative to Guard) | If **lynched during the day**, can reveal identity to **stay alive** (but loses vote). Gains right to **interrupt** others’ speeches. Dies if killed at night. | Provides resilience against mislynch. |

## **Sheriff (Police Chief) – Day 1 Only**

- Elected via **Day 1** pre-discussion vote:
  - Volunteers speak → non-volunteers vote.
  - Ties are resolved by experienced players (details not needed for beginners).
- **Powers**:
  1. **1.5 votes** in all future votes.
  2. Sets **speaking order** (e.g., “dead left” or “sheriff right”).
  3. **Final summary (“closing vote”)**: Recommends who to lynch.
  4. On death, can **pass badge** or **tear it up** (no sheriff thereafter).

- **Key Terms**:
  - **"On-Police"**: Players who ran for sheriff.
  - **"Off-Police"**: Players who did not run.
  - **"Step Down"**: Withdrawing from sheriff race after nominating.
